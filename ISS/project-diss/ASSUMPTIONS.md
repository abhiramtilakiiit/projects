# Assumptions

- We are allowed to use 3rd party fonts.
- We use the terminology artist-albums page, album-songs page and list of artists page
  instead of the one given in instruction to avoid confusion.
- We have a few extra artists featured that don't have atleast 5 albums. Some of these ablums don't have 5 songs either. However, we have made sure to feature the first 5 artists with atleast 5 albums as per requirement, and each of these albums have atleast 5 songs.
