About Us ( DISS )

DISS, stands for duo for ISS, is a duo consisting of Ankith Pai (ankith.pai@research.iiit.ac.in) and Abhiram Tilak (abhiram.tilak@research.iiit.ac.in) 

As we began working on our music review website, we drew inspiration from a number of other websites that we admired. We looked at how they presented their content, how they engaged with their readers, and how they built a sense of community around their platform.

One thing that stood out to us was how many of these websites were able to achieve great things with minimal resources. They didn't have huge budgets or teams of people working around the clock. Instead, they focused on what really mattered: creating quality content.

This inspired us to take a similar approach with our own website. We knew that we didn't have the same resources as some of the bigger players in the industry, but we also knew that we had something unique to offer. By focusing on what we were good at and being resourceful with what we had, we were able to build a website that we're proud of.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without the support and encouragement of our readers. We're grateful for every person who visits our website, leaves a comment, or shares our content with their friends. It's your enthusiasm and engagement that keeps us going, and we're committed to continuing to provide you with the best music reviews we can.
