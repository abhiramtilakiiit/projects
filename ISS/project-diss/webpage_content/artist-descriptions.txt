rick astley discription:

Besides being one of the most successful british singer of the 80's with his popular 1987 hit "Never Gonna Give You Up" (and the rather funny and random Internet prank that it generated), Rick Astley is also, just like Longcat, Slowpoke and Pedobear, among others, an idol in the Internet. If you don't agree, then you're either: 1. a newfag, or 2. stupid.

If you've been rick rolled, don't rage! Enjoy the funny video and accept the fact that Astley just pwned the crap out of you.

He was born in 1966, and up to date keeps rick rolling people IRL, although has never been as famous as he was in the late 80's, and now admits his hit has a very stupid letter.

After YouTube made it an old meme in April, 2008, there have been numerous attempts to replace the prank. The most successful video so far has been the "Jizz in my Pants" song, whose creators power level is certainly not even close to that of Astley, but the "Jizz Roll" is on its way to success.

He is one crazy emcee and he honestly just doesnt give a flip about cereal. It's not that he doesnt care about things, its more like he doesnt give a flip a lot.

Dizzee Rascal:

A term coined by medieval English mothers who used to punish their naughty little children by spinning them round in circles until their voices became ludicrously high and started "MCing", a form of babbling over crappy production

the only hope garage / grime music has in surviving in the music industry. Although garage is growing, its many, many years form being on the same level commercially as rnb hiphop, rock, pop etc.

Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827)
Possibly the most revolutionary and effective composer of all time, Ludwig van Beethoven wrote 9 symphonies with sketches for a tenth, 5 piano concerti, a violin concerto, 32 sonatas (not 23 like it says up there), 16 string quartets, and other various works: in all, over 130 number opera (plural of opus) and numerous other works labeled 'work without opus'. His five piano concerti have sold more copies than almost any other classical record. Beethoven was composer in both the classical and romantic periods. His third symphony in Eb major, "eroica," is said to be the beginning of the romantic period.
Near his last 20 years of life, he finally accepted he was going deaf and went into a state of severe depression, during which he composed very little, but what he did compose, including the famous "chorale" symphony in Dm (no. 9), was great. Unfortunately, his opera, Fidelio, failed horribly because of Beethoven's diminishing hearing.
The greatest mistake of Beethoven's career was Work Without Opus No. 59: Bagatelle in A minor (Für Elise for you non-musicologists). This piece, besides mozart's K 545, is the most-spammed piece by pianists in the history of the world. In fact, it pisses them off, so just don't play it!

Kanye West:
Call him what you may. An ahole, a genius or a guyfish (even though its terribly old now). But one thing is for sure: the mainstream music industry needs him, and that is why he's so valuable. Anyone with any knowledge would know that Kanye has made one of the biggest impacts on hip-hop. The College Dropout was the mark of a new era in hip-hop. He was never the soulful rapper, he was the different one. From his high-pitched samples, all the way to working with John Mayer and Adam Levine. What people don't see is this: he started a foundation to help kids get through school, blamed himself for his mothers tragic death, and all people can look at is the Taylor Swift incident. Kanye may not be the best person in the world, but without him, music simply wouldn't be the same.

Pete and Bas:
In a land not too dissimilar from our own, two elderlies found themselves the unwilling victims of a curse inflicted upon them by a vengeful wizard. Rather than accepting their fate and withering away, the pair instead began to age in reverse, growing stronger and more agile with each passing day. And so, armed with the knowledge and experience of their long lives, the two set out on a quest to clean dem streeetz, and blended in with the Brixton drill scene. Despite the incredulous looks and dismissive comments of those around them, the determined duo pressed on, taking on the toughest challenges and facing down the most fearsome foes with all the courage and cunning they could muster. And as they worked to cleanse the city of its blight, they slowly but surely began to see the world around them with fresh eyes, grateful for the chance to live a life anew. 
Now all they have to offer is fine tuned melodies they got inspired during their quest.
